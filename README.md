## About the Creator

I am a Computer Science freshman at Georgia Tech. I created this website as a coding and food enthusiast to help as many people as possible. My company acquires food worth 10% of the earnings made everyday after all deliveries are over to donate to food banks and underprivileged people all around us. Provided such a partial layout and template of webpage to local businessmen.
